## Intro Video

As Keyframe Toolbox is still in beta, we're still making tweaks and changes to the user interface.

Once we're happy, we'll release a proper introduction video here.

## Why do you need this?

Whilst Final Cut Pro has some BASIC keyframe controls for Opacity, Position, Scale, Rotation - they're very limited and hard to control.

For example, in Final Cut Pro you can't easily ramp these parameters.

Keyframe Toolbox gives you COMPLETE control of your keyframes so you can really refine your movements.

We're attempting to take all the very best keyframe controls from Apple Motion, Adobe After Effects, Autodesk Flame, Blender, etc and build them directly into the Final Cut Pro Inspector!

This is a power tool for people who want to do complex animations without leaving the Final Cut Pro timeline.
