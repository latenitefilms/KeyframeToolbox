However, here's a list of commands you can use to control keyframes and handles. Right now, option and command are equivalent, to hopefully make it easier for users of both Motion and After Effects to work with handles. This may change. Currently, control-clicking and right-clicking are not the same — right clicking doesn't do anything.","In the Keyframe Toolbox interface you'll see several graphs, each one controlling a separate parameter.","In the current effect, graphs include Opacity, Position X, Position Y, Scale, Rotation, and Blur."]},{"l":"Keyframe graph basics","p":["Each graph starts with has a keyframe at the start (left) and end (right) and a line connecting them.","These two keyframes cannot be removed, but they can be moved horizontally.","If the playhead is over the clip, a line indicates the position of the timeline playhead in relation to the clip.","The graph width maps to the clip width, while the graph height maps to the values of the property, within the limits shown to the right of that graph.","Opacity has a fixed 0..100 range, while the other properties use defaults that should make sense.","All other limits can be changed by dragging them, horizontally or vertically. Hold option as you drag to change both sides in opposite directions.","Press the button between the limits to fit the graph to the current values within it, plus a small buffer."]},{"l":"Adding and moving keyframes","p":["Keyframes can be moved and new keyframes can be added.","Double-click on a graph line to add a linear keyframe and remember a value at a point in time.","Click and drag on a keyframe to move it.","During the drag, numbers will appear showing the keyfrane's value (above) and time (below).","SHIFT drag on a keyframe to lock movement to horizontal (time) or vertical (value) movement.","If you move a keyframe on one graph to a position near a keyframe on another graph, a vertical line will appear.","If SHIFT is now held down, the keyframe will snap to this line to align with keyframes on other properties.","SHIFT dragging a keyframe will also snap to the line that indicates the playhead position, if present.","Dragging a line connnecting two keyframes will move both keyframes together."]},{"l":"Smoothing keyframes","p":["Handles connected to keyframes control the graph curve that controls how one value changes into another.","OPTION or COMMAND drag on a line to add a non-linear keyframe, dragging out two symmetric handles to create a bezier curve.","OPTION or COMMAND drag on a keyframe to add handles to a linear keyframe, or reset and redraw the handles on an existing non-linear keyframe.","Optionally, hold SHIFT while doing this to lock the curve to horizontal (0°).","OPTION or COMMAND click on a keyframe to remove handles and reset the keyframe to linear.","OPTION or COMMAND drag on a handle to split a handle pair and make it asymmetric.","SHIFT drag a handle to maintain its current angle and only change distance."]},{"l":"Deleting keyframes and handles","p":["Keyframes and handles can be deleted.","CONTROL click on a keyframe to delete it.","CONTROL click on a handle to delete it.
