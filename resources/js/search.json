However, here's a list of commands you can use to control keyframes and handles. Right now, option and command are equivalent, to hopefully make it easier for users of both Motion and After Effects to work with handles. This may change. Currently, control-clicking and right-clicking are not the same — right clicking doesn't do anything.","In the Keyframe Toolbox interface you'll see several graphs, each one controlling a separate parameter.","In the current effect, graphs include Opacity, Position X, Position Y, Scale, Rotation, and Blur."]},{"l":"Keyframe graph basics","p":["Each graph starts with has a keyframe at the start (left) and end (right) and a line connecting them.","These two keyframes cannot be removed, but they can be moved horizontally.","If the playhead is over the clip, a line indicates the position of the timeline playhead in relation to the clip.","The graph width maps to the clip width, while the graph height maps to the values of the property, within the limits shown to the right of that graph.","Opacity has a fixed 0..100 range, while the other properties use defaults that should make sense.","All other limits can be changed by dragging them, horizontally or vertically. Hold option as you drag to change both sides in opposite directions.","Press the button between the limits to fit the graph to the current values within it, plus a small buffer."]},{"l":"Adding and moving keyframes","p":["Keyframes can be moved and new keyframes can be added.","Double-click on a graph line to add a linear keyframe and remember a value at a point in time.","Click and drag on a keyframe to move it.","During the drag, numbers will appear showing the keyfrane's value (above) and time (below).","Shift-drag on a keyframe to lock movement to horizontal (time) or vertical (value) movement.","If you move a keyframe on one graph to a position near a keyframe on another graph, a vertical line will appear.","If shift is now held down, the keyframe will snap to this line to align with keyframes on other properties.","Shift-dragging a keyframe will also snap to the line that indicates the playhead position, if present.","Dragging a line connnecting two keyframes will move both keyframes together."]},{"l":"Smoothing keyframes","p":["Handles connected to keyframes control the graph curve that controls how one value changes into another.","Option- or command- drag on a line to add a non-linear keyframe, dragging out two symmetric handles to create a bezier curve.","Option- or command-drag on a keyframe to add handles to a linear keyframe, or reset and redraw the handles on an existing non-linear keyframe.","Optionally, hold shift while doing this to lock the curve to horizontal (0°).","Option- or command-click on a keyframe to remove handles and reset the keyframe to linear.","Option- or command-drag on a handle to split a handle pair and make it asymmetric.-** Shift-drag a handle** to maintain its current angle and only change distance."]},{"l":"Deleting keyframes and handles","p":["Keyframes and handles can be deleted.","Control-click on a keyframe to delete it.","Control-click on a handle to delete it. This operation only deletes one handle in a symmetric pair.","Though the first and last keyframes cannot be deleted, you can control-click on the first keyframe to duplicate the value of the second keyframe, or control-click on the last keyframe to duplicate the value of second-last keyframe."]},{"l":"Working with precision","p":["Exact numbers can be entered for keyframes and handles.","Double-click on any keyframe to see its value (above) and time (below).","Double-click on any handle to see its distance (above) and angle (below).","In both these cases, type in new values to change them, then approve the change by presing Return or Enter, or cancel the change with Escape.","Altenatively, use up and down arrows to change the values by 1, and shift-up and shift-down arrows to change the values by 10."]},{"l":"Selecting, moving and scaling keyframes","p":["Multiple keyframes can be selected and manipulated.","Clicking a keyframe selects it.","Shift-clicking additional keyframes selects additional keyframes.","Drag from empty space across one or more keyframes to create a selection marquee that selectes enclosed keyframes.","Hold shift as you drag a selection box to select additional keyframes.","When multiple keyframes have been selected, a bounding box appears that allows the selected keyframes to be scaled and/or moved.","Drag one of the selected keyframes to move them, or drag the sides or corners of the bounding box to move the contained keyframes proportionally to one another.","Hold shift as you drag one of multiple selected keyframes to constrain to horizontal or vertical movement.","Click elsewhere in the graph to dismiss the bounding box."]},{"l":"Using the reset button and the graph menu","p":["Next to each graph's name is a reset button and a menu that enables some advanced features.","Each property graph can be reset using the reset button next to its name.","Shift-click any graph's reset button to reset all graphs at once.","Use Copy Graph to copy all keyframes from a graph.","Use Paste Graph to paste copied keyframes from one graph into another graph.","When a single keyframe is selected, use Copy Value from Previous Keyframe or Copy Value from Next Keyframe to do that.","If no keyframes are selected, an entire graph can be reversed in time by choosing Time-Reverse Graph.","If two or more contiguous keyframes are selected, they can be reversed by choosing Time-Reverse Keyframes."]},{"l":"Settings","p":["This doesn't do anything yet.","We do plan to add presets.","If anything doesn't make sense or feels off, let me know!-iain"]}],[{"l":"Support","p":["If you run into any bugs, crashes, or you have a feature request, you can post an issue here.","If you have any general questions or feedback, you can discuss here.","GitHub registration is free, and this GitHub repository is actively monitored by LateNite.","You can also email us: support@latenitefilms.com","We're based in Melbourne, Australia- you can check the timezone here."]}],[{"l":"Release Notes"},{"l":"1.0.0 (Build 9)","p":["\uD83C\uDF89 Released:","TBC","This is the first release of Keyframe Toolbox.
